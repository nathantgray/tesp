Read original.glm
Read model configuration
	Read-in glm_config.json5 - User-defined values that may override defaults
	Read-in gld_defaults.json5 - Legacy defaults 
Read in RECS data, pre-processes  - defines some model parameters and (one day) cross-correlations
	recs_data_set() - Uses "state", "RECS data path", and "income distribution" from glm_config.json5
Add to model: .glm preamble 
	includes
		schedules
			appliance_schedules - Only if glm_config "enduses" calls out "ZIPload"
			water_and_setpoint_schedules - always
			commercial_schedules - always
	objects
		climate
			tmyfile - defined in glm_config
			interpolation - "QUADRATIC"
	class player
		always add
			"class player {
				 double value; 
			};"
	#sets
		minimum_timestep - glm_config
		profiler - 1
	modules
		powerflow - Use default
			module powerflow {
    			solver_method NR;
     			NR_iteration_limit 50;
     			lu_solver "KLU_x64";
			};
		tape
		climate
		residential	
			default is GLD built-in (defined in residential module declaration, see https://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Residential_(module))
		generator
Identify & classify load conversion points - Triplex nodes after service transformers
	identify_xfmr_houses()
Generate residential customer 
	add_houses()
		enduses - if not using gld implicit enduses, add in ZIPload objects with schedules
		Water heater - glm_config to define distribution of water heater type
Add object to house object
	EVcharger_det object - glm_config for installation factor and battery size distribution
Add sub-meters to billing meter
	Solar - glm_config for installation factor (whether a given house gets it)
		inverter object- glm_config for rated power
		solar panel object - glm_config for rated power distribution
	Battery - glm_config for installation factor (whether a given house gets it)
		inverter - glm_config for efficiency
		battery - glm_config for efficiency and size
Redistribute excess load
	add_small_loads()
Generate commercial loads at commercial load conversion points - We're not doing anything new here.
Write out .glm
	modified.glm
(Future feature) GLMInspect - new class that users can use to provide insight into the model
	Summarizes changes made and prints to console
	Detailed summary to output JSON
	Makes graphs of various parameter values
	Make visual representation of model (using existing networkx layout)
