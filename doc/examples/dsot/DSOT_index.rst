DSO+T Analysis
==============

The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory completed a multi-year study where a transactive energy system was implemented to allow a number of distribution system assets to participate in an integrated retail and wholesale real-time and day-ahead energy markets. The study had the following specific objectives

* Does the large-scale transactive coordination produce stable, effective control?
* Is a DSO+T deployment of flexible assets at-scale cost effective, particularly comparing batteries vs flexible loads and deployments in moderate- vs high-renewable power systems?
* How much could a DSO+T implementation benefit and save consumers, looking at comparisons between those that participate in the transactive system and those that don't and residential versus commercial customers.

This documentation is a brief summary of a much more extensive series of reports.
